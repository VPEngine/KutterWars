# Kutter Wars

Kutter Discount Wars offers a videogame based e-commerce experience.

Users play a simple alien-caterpillar invasion game and their play score determines the discount they'll get on all purchases in the store.

The discounts will range from 0 - 25%, depending on the user's play score.

After a user is done playing the game, a discount coupon is generated and the user can "Proceed to Shopping" on the Wix shop using that coupon.
